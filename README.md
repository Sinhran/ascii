# IMAGE TO ASCII

~~This is something that I've decided to do to help with my C++ journey.
The entire project will be written in C++ and hopefully without the use 
of any external libraries.~~
~~Will be rewriting it in C because C++ sucks.~~
Never mind that, it's still going to be in C++. Got rid of the error.

~## ONLY SUPPORTS BMP AS OF NOW~
No BMP for now. Only manually inputting the pixels. That too, in black and white.

### Support for PNG will be added later
